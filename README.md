# DodgeR

This is part of a project to evaluate the godot-rust bindings [gdext](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext).

It is derived from the Dodge-the-creeps example game: 
[gdext dodge-the-creeps](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext/tree/master/examples/dodge-the-creeps),
which is a finished Rust version of the game featured in the
["Your first 2D game"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)
tutorial in the godot documentation.

Language: Rust

Renderer: Vulkan Mobile

The evaluation project consists of four Repositories:
- [this](https://github.com/franziskusz/dodge-r)
- [GDScript Version](https://github.com/franziskusz/dodge-gds)
- [process-logger](https://github.com/franziskusz/process-logger)
- [python-pandas-plotter](https://github.com/franziskusz/pandas-plotter)

## Idea
Combining the open source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org) with the performant language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) seems like a good fit.
Since the bindings are still in development and with not too many finished projects available, the questions of why, where and how to use Rust within Godot are regularly asked.
From the [discord server](https://discord.gg/aKUCJ8rJsc) it can be learned, that GDScript might be more performant when it comes to frequent calls to the engine, while Rust might be more performant, when it comes to actual calculations.
However, actual numbers are rare and opinions on how to benchmark game applications differ.

Since I am kind of new to Rust, Godot, benchmarking and programming, I decided for the following approach:

The main idea was to create two versions of the Dodge-the-Creeps game that are suitable for benchmarking. 
Therefore different optional possibilities to scale and adjust the workload were implemented:
 - Spawn an initial mob wave.
 - Spawn mobs over time.
 - Adjust the spawn intervall.
 - Add additional calculating and drawing tasks per mob per frame.
 - Scale the number of calculations.
 - Make the player character auto move to constantly trigger the targeting function of the mobs.

The [GDScript Version](https://github.com/franziskusz/dodge-gdscript) is besides some minor differences functionally and structurally an 1:1 copy of this, but in pure GDScript.

As a result there are now two versions of basically the same game or benchmark application – one in pure Rust, one in pure GDScript – where the amount of engine calls and the amount of performance intensive calculations and thus their relation to each other can be adjusted almost freely.

Both applications write performance logs to timestamped .csv files within the `/app_userdata/` folder. See [godot file paths](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html) for details.

## How To Test
The whole testing process:
1. Chose scaling settings that suit your need or interest.
2. Start the process-logger entering the the name of process you wish to start with (DodgeR or DodgeGDS for this purpose).
3. Start the corresponding Dodge Version.
4. Run it with the chosen settings for the desired time or until it shuts down because of the fps limit.
5. Stop the process logger.
6. Repeat 2-5 as many times as you want to get average values.
7. Repeat 2-6 for the other Dodge Version.
8. Collect the .csv results in four separate folders (eg. /dodge-r-godot/, /dodge-r-process/, /dodge-gds-godot/, /dodge-gds-process/).
9. Invoke the python pandas script with the four folders as arguments to calculate the arithmetic mean and plot it as well as the difference.

## Notes
- To dodge (haHAA) breaking changes of the gdext bindings I included a local version within this repository (/gdext/). It is an unmodified Version from early January 2024.
- As said before, I am new to Godot and Rust. This whole project is also a learning experience for me. If the way some things are implemented gives you headaches, I am sorry. I am open for any kind of criticism.
- .csv logging is based on the Rust crate [csv](https://crates.io/crates/csv)
- The additional calculation workload is based on [godot-rust-benchmark](https://github.com/extrawurst/godot-rust-benchmark/tree/main)
